        Suppose that "s" is a string of length "ls", and we are looking for
        strings with at least "sim" Jaccard similarity.
        To be sure that we do not have to compare "s" with "t", we must be certain that "sim" > ("ls" ? "p")/"ls". That
        is, "p" must be at least [(1 ? "sim")"ls"] + 1. Of course we want "p" to be as small as
        possible, so we do not index string s in more buckets than we need to. Thus,
        we shall hereafter take "p" = [(1 ? "sim")"ls"+ 1 to be the length of the prefix that
        gets indexed.
         P.S : "p" being the prefix of potential strings to be compared to "s"
         Case 1: p ? q. Here, the maximum size of the intersection is
            Ls ? i + 1 ? (p ? q)
            Since Ls = i + p, we can write the above expression for the intersection size as
            q + 1. The minimum size of the union is Ls + j ? 1, as it was when we did not
            take suffix length into account. Thus, we require
            (q + 1) /(Ls + j ? 1) ? J whenever p ? q.
         Case 2: p < q. Here, the maximum size of the intersection is Ls ? i + 1, as
            when suffix length was not considered. However, the minimum size of the union
            is now Ls + j ? 1 + q ? p. If we again use the relationship Ls = i + p, we can
            replace Ls ? p by i and get the formula i + j ? 1 + q for the size of the union.
            If the Jaccard similarity is at least J, then
            (Ls ? i + 1) / (i + j ? 1 + q) ? J
            whenever p < q.
